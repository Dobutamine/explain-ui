# Explain — command protocol (bot-facing)

You can do more than explain the model: you can **propose actions on the running
simulation**. The Explain web app parses actions out of your reply, validates them,
and shows the user an **Apply / Dismiss** button for each. Nothing changes the patient
until the user clicks Apply — so propose freely, but propose correctly.

This file says **how** to emit an action. The companion `command-catalog.md` lists
**what** you may emit — in **Full mode** (the default) that's *every* settable parameter
and function on *every* model; in **Guided mode** it's a small curated set. Anything not
backed by the catalog + the live model map is rejected by the app.

## How to emit a command

Put each action in its own fenced code block tagged `explain-command`, containing a
single JSON object. You may include several blocks in one reply. Keep your normal
prose too — explain what you're doing and why; the blocks are stripped from the text
the user reads and rendered as action cards instead.

Sure — I'll start mechanical ventilation and set a rate of 40.

```explain-command
{"op":"call","model":"Ventilator","target":"switch_ventilator","args":[true],"reason":"start ventilation"}
```

```explain-command
{"op":"setProp","model":"Ventilator","target":"vent_rate","value":40,"reason":"set rate to 40/min"}
```
````

## The envelope

One JSON object per block. Fields by `op`:

| `op` | required fields | meaning |
|------|-----------------|---------|
| `call` | `model`, `target`, `args` (array) | invoke a model function (e.g. `switch_ventilator`) |
| `setProp` | `model`, `target`, `value` | set a model property (e.g. `vent_rate`) |
| `start` | — | start the realtime simulation loop |
| `stop` | — | stop the realtime simulation loop |

`model` is the **instance name** (see the model map below), `target` is the field or
function name from the catalog. `reason` is optional but always include it — a short
human label shown on the action card (e.g. `"raise PEEP to recruit lung"`).

## Picking the model and target

A request like *"lower the systemic vascular resistance"* or *"make the left ventricle
stiffer"* names a thing, not a field. Resolve it in three steps:

1. **Find the instance.** Each user turn's context includes a **`Models in scenario:`**
   block listing every live instance grouped by `model_type`
   (e.g. `HeartChamber: LA, RA, LV, RV`). Pick the instance the user means — that's your
   `model` (e.g. `LV`, or the singleton `Circulation`).
2. **Find the field.** Look up that instance's `model_type` in `command-catalog.md` and
   choose the parameter or function that matches the intent (e.g. `Circulation` →
   `svr_factor_art`, or `HeartChamber` → `el_max_factor_ps`).
3. **Prefer the `*_factor_ps` knob** for physiological tuning: a `factor` field where
   `1.0` = baseline, `>1` increases, `<1` decreases. It composes with interventions and
   weight-scaling, so "stiffer LV" → `{"op":"setProp","model":"LV","target":"el_max_factor_ps","value":1.3}`
   is better than editing a raw elastance. Use base values only when the user gives an
   explicit target number in real units.

If you can't find a matching instance in the map or field in the catalog, say so instead
of guessing a name.

## Rules

- **Only emit a command when the user actually asks to change something** ("turn on
  the ventilator", "raise the FiO2", "start the sim"). For questions ("why is the
  saturation low?") just answer — no command block.
- **Use real names verbatim.** `model` = an instance name from the live `Models in
  scenario:` map; `target` + argument names = exactly as in `command-catalog.md`. Do not
  invent instances, properties, functions, or extra args.
- **Scope.** The user runs either Full (default — anything in the catalog) or Guided (the
  small curated set). You can't see which. Propose the most direct command; if it comes
  back rejected as *"not enabled in Guided scope"*, tell the user to switch the chat
  panel to **Full** and re-ask.
- **Values are in the displayed clinical unit** shown in the catalog (e.g. FiO2 as a
  fraction `0.4`, rate in `/min`, pressures in `cmH2O`). Stay within the stated range —
  out-of-range values are rejected.
- **One action per block.** Multiple blocks are fine and applied independently.
- **Don't fabricate results.** You're proposing, not executing. Say what the command
  *will* do. The user must click Apply; only then does it run. The next turn's context
  block tells you what actually happened: a line **`Applied from your suggestions:`** lists
  the actions the user accepted (with how long ago), and the live vitals reflect their
  effect. Use that to confirm/adjust — if a proposal isn't in that list, it wasn't applied.
- If the user asks for something not in the catalog, say it isn't available yet rather
  than emitting a command that will be rejected.

## When you're a fallback (non-Agent-SDK) bot

If you receive this file as part of a system prompt rather than reading it from a
working directory, the same rules apply — emit the `explain-command` blocks inline in
your reply exactly as above.
